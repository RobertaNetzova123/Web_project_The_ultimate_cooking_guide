       <p>
           Egg to water ratio – The more water you use relative to the number of eggs,
           the longer it will take to boil and the longer it will retain heat.
           Too much water and your eggs will cook too fast, too little and the
           temperature will fall too fast, resulting in uncooked eggs.
           Ideally, you’d measure out a certain amount of water for each
           egg you’re boiling. But that seems a little extreme for something so simple.
           I typically use a pot that comfortably houses the number of eggs
           I’m going to cook (not crowded, not too spaced out), and then cover the eggs
           with enough water so there’s about 1″ of water above the top of the eggs.

        <ul class = "ingredients">
            <li>2 minutes – The white isn’t fully set and the yolk is totally raw. </li>
            <li>4 minutes – The white is fully set, but the yolk is thick and runny.</li>
            <li>6 minutes – The yolk is mostly set, but still a little runny in the middle.</li>
            <li>8 minutes – The white is fully set, and the yolk is set, but tender.</li>
            <li>10 minutes – The white is fully set, and the yolk is fully set.</li>
